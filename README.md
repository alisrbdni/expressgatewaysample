nodejs,express app sample for user request management , using express gateway

for installation :

make sure you have npm installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)

clone or download repo

open terminal :

cd root

npm install

then run the server with:

npm start



open another terminal and replace {APIKEY} in 


curl -H "Authorization: apiKey {APIKEY}" localhost:3000/{city name},{country code}

e.g:

curl -H "Authorization: apiKey 65MSOnXLbTe4bAVoKDD6Dh:1WafzGidMw5wtO5jh7SVsI" localhost:3000/sydney,au

with apiKeys generated by running following commands in a new terminal while server is running :

eg users create
eg credentials create -c USERNAME -t key-auth -q


(these APIKEYS are stored in memory and will be reseted after server restart and will not be authorized on your machine ,although this can be resolved by using redis
 and import/export data to restore in-memory database on other machines;unfortunatly windows(my os) is not officially supported by redis)

(you can change that at ./congif/gateway.config.yml under -rate-limit)
